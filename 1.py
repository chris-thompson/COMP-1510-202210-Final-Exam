"""
(3 points) Implement an annotated recursive function called sum_of_digits that accepts a positive
           integer and returns the sum of the digits in the integer.

           For example:

           sum_of_digits(123) will return 6 (not "6" which is a string) because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

(1 point) If this function is passed a negative integer, it must raise a ValueException.

(1 point) This function needs a docstring that includes 2 useful doctests.

(1 point) Prove this function correctly raises a ValueException when passed a negative inside the
        main function. Do not let the program crash!
